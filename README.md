# RPE Calculator

An calculator for determining training weights based on Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).

## How to use
- Input the weight, reps, and your RPE for a given set.
- Input your desired reps and RPE for your next set.
- The calculator will output the recommended weight for your next set based on the provided inputs.
- The calculations are unit-agnostic, so you can use either pounds or kilograms.
- The bar loader will show you how to load the bar for that weight, given your choice of collars and units.

## What is RPE
- RPE is a measurement of exertion used to gauge the intensity of an exercise.
- A set at RPE 10 means you could not perform any more reps.
- A set at RPE 9 means you could perform 1 more rep.
- A set at RPE 8 means you could perform 2 more reps, etc.

## Where do the numbers come from?
- A chart on the wall of my old gym, slightly modified to be a linear scale.
